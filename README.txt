Geolocation is a C# class library that will calculate distance and cardinal direction between two sets of coordinates. Additionally (and perhaps more importantly), a CoordinateBoundaries class is provided that will, given an origin coordinate and radius, provide the lat/long boundaries around the origin allowing for simple SQL or LINQ selection of locations within the given radius. A sample ASP.NET web forms application is included to demonstrate usage.
